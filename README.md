Diabetes Health, Lifestyle &amp; Demographic Analysis is a data analytics project that explores how lifestyle habits, demographic factors, and clinical indicators affect diabetes. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and interactive Tableau dashboards to identify high-risk groups and key health patterns.

Comprehensive Dataset Analysis
Analyzed 18,000+ records combining demographic, lifestyle, and clinical health data from multiple public sources.

Multiple Data Sources
Data collected from Kaggle, WHO, and public health datasets to ensure diversity and coverage.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values using Mean, Median, and Mode, removed duplicates, corrected data types, and encoded categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to identify trends, distributions, and relationships.

Lifestyle & Clinical Insights
Studied the impact of diet type, sleep duration, physical activity, daily steps, BMI, glucose, and cholesterol on diabetes risk.

Diabetes Type Comparison
Compared Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes across age groups, gender, and countries.

Interactive Dashboards
Built Tableau dashboards to visualize demographic trends, lifestyle patterns, and clinical indicators.

High-Risk Group Identification
Identified high-risk populations based on age (40–60), high-carb diet, high BMI, and family history.

Real-World Health Insights
Translated analytical findings into actionable health recommendations.
